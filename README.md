**HuskHomesGUI** is a GUI add-on plugin for [HuskHomes v4.x](https://github.com/WiIIiam278/HuskHomes2) on Spigot
servers. It provides a chest-style graphical user interface (GUI) for browsing home and warp lists as well as editing
homes.

It replaces the chat menu system that is built into HuskHomes when you type `/homelist`, `/phomelist` or `/warplist` and
includes anvil-based rename and description editing functionality to allow for easy editing.

If you prefer to browse using a menu, or would like better support for Bedrock players connecting over Geyser, then this
add-on is for you.

## Setup

1. Make a Server in **1.20.4/1.20.6** (``Only tested with this versions``)
2. Have ``HuskHomes v4.x+`` installed on your server(s)
3. Download [HuskHomesGUI](https://github.com/jesperrichert/HuskHomesGUI/releases) and place it in your
   server's `~/plugins/` folder

## Usage

Simply use the list commands you are familiar with to bring up a list of homes or warps.
Then you can left-click to teleport to a home/warp, right click to edit it, and shift-left click to change the icon of
the home in the list to match the type of item in your main hand. Use the page navigation buttons to switch pages.
